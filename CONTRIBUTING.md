## Reporting bugs or requesting features

Please use the issue templates provided to create your bug reports or feature requests. Please include as much detail as possible.

## Contributing code

Before contributing code, please double check that there is no related PR already open, and check for any existing issues describing the bug you want to fix or feature you want to implement.

If you want to implement a new feature, please create an issue first, so your feature can be discussed before you implement it. This way, your PR doesn't get denied based on the feature not being aligned with what we want with the project.

Please double check:
- That your commits are in logical units;
- Your commit messages are clear and descriptive;
- That you sign-off your commits.
